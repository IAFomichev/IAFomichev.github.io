        <p>I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the European University Institute. I was a visiting assistant in research at the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale University in Fall 2022. Currently, I lead the Research Analytics Unit at the EUI, mentoring PhD researchers in statistical programming (R and Python), empirical research design, and data analysis.</p> 
        
        <p>I research political behavior and attitudes in authoritarian regimes, with my dissertation focusing on how political information—such as signals of regime electoral vulnerability, public dissent, and war fatalities—shapes citizens' political responses.</p>
        
        <p>I hold a BS in Political Science from Saint Petersburg State University and an MS in Political Science from the European University at Saint Petersburg, both with honors.</p>

            Strategic Voting, Image of Invincibility, and Partisanship: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Russia
          </a></i>.

        <p class="abstract">
          This paper examines what drives strategic voting in authoritarian elections, using the case of Russia’s Smart Voting campaign. Based on a survey experiment in Saint Petersburg before the 2021 State Duma election, I find that partisan (ideological) distance between voters and candidates strongly affects willingness to vote strategically. In contrast, challenging the perception of the regime’s invincibility had no measurable impact.

            The Effect of Spatial Proximity to Protests on Voting in Russia
          </a></i>.

        <p class="abstract">
          This paper studies how local protests affect electoral outcomes in authoritarian regimes, focusing on Russia between 2016 and 2021. Using data from anti-corruption and pension reform protests, I show that proximity to protests reduced both voter turnout and ruling party support, especially in strongholds of United Russia. However, protest proximity did not significantly boost opposition vote share.

        <p class="abstract">
          This study explores the political impact of reported war fatalities in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Analyzing over 20 million social media posts from geo-referenced local groups, we find that reports of soldiers killed in action lead to a sustained decline in engagement with content featuring authorities. At the same time, engagement with patriotic and military topics rises temporarily.
